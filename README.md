# ITO-Web-Redesign

## Objectives (for now)

1. Decide on a Tech Stack (for now this project is front end exclusive)
* âœ“ React with TypeScript is what the group has agreed on
2. Start using Figma to Plan the new Site
* I don't want this entire semester to be us drawing a wireframe, so once we have one or 
two pages (landing page and one sub page) I want to get us coding as soon as possible because
that's why we're all here.
* link to our Figma is here: https://www.figma.com/team_invite/redeem/7QTOnuyyzsJQijOqYilRU2
3. Break up work into by people/groups
* Web development is can be tricky to do collaboratively.
That being said, I would ideally like everyone to have their own page/component to work on
given that the team size is small enough to which that might be permittable. Once we start
getting into the nitty gritty of coding anyone is more than welcome to contribute however
they like though, I'm not here to make you do something you don't want to.
